# F1TwitterBio

With the F1 season now complete, the silly season is almost over, with all but Hamilton confirmed for next year (as of 21-12-2020).
But with all of this Mazepin, Illott and Fittipaldi changing their Twitter bios, we never know what will happen.

This project helps you track what's going on by notifying you when a driver, or a team updates their Twitter bio.
To use, add your API credentials in the given line and simply run the program.

To track another driver/team/Team Principal's bio changes, add their name to the drivers array and Twutter handle to the twthandle array.
Make sure that both are added at the same index.
